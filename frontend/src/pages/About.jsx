            Why TrackDeck?
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            TrackDeck was built to eliminate the chaos of manual tracking
            spreadsheets. Whether you're ordering products for clients or
            managing personal purchases, it gives you structure, reminders, and
            insights. Say goodbye to missed refunds and unreviewed products â€”
            and hello to a smoother, more reliable workflow.
